The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.
Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer)
Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. You’ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling.
Many of the elements on this page are very similar to things you saw in our flexbox exercises… feel free to go back to those if you need a refresher.
When you finish, don’t forget to push it up to GitHub!
